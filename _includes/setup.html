<h3>(Optional) software installation: Overview</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
      The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
      which is not famous for being intuitive.
      if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
      try typing the escape key,
      followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark),
      then hitting Return
      to return to the shell.
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
      lets you track who made changes to what when and has
      options for easily updating a shared or public version of
      your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      We teach with Python version 2.7,
      since it is still the most widely used.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all-in-one installer.

<h3>(Optional) software installation: Windows</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
      popular free code editor for Windows.
      Be aware that you must add its installation directory to your system path
      in order to launch it from the command line
      (or have other tools like Git launch it for you).
      Please ask your instructor to help you do this.
    </p>
    <h4>Git Bash</h4>
    <p>
      Install Git for Windows by download and running
      <a href="https://msysgit.googlecode.com/files/Git-1.8.4-preview20130916.exe">the installer</a>.
      This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download and install  <a href="http://continuum.io/anacondace.html">Anaconda CE</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use all of the defaults for installation
        <em>except</em>
        make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the default Python</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>(Optional) software installation: Mac OS X</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash,
      so no need to install anything.  You access bash from
      the Terminal (found
      in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want
      to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
    </p>
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      We recommend
      <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
      <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
      In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
      which should be pre-installed.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Install Git for Mac by download and running
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">the installer</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download and install  <a href="http://continuum.io/anacondace.html">Anaconda CE</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use all of the defaults for installation
        <em>except</em>
        make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the default Python</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>(Optional) software installation: Linux</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>,
      but if your machine is set up differently
      you can run it by opening a terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.
      There is no need to install anything.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      If Git is not already available on your machine you can try
      to install it via your distro's package manager
      (e.g. <code>apt-get</code>).
    </p>
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for Linux users.
      In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
      which should be pre-installed.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer
      <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>.
      (Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
      comfortable doing the installation yourself just
      download the installer and we'll help you at the boot
      camp.)
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Download the installer that matches your operating
        system and save it in your home folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open a terminal window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
        tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
        appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press enter. You will follow the text-only
        prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the
        screen press the down arrow to move down through the
        text. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve
        the license. Press enter to approve the default
        location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to
        your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda
        distribution the default Python).
